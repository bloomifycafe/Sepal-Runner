# Sepal runner: CUDA matrix-multiply provider

The first slice of stage R2 of [../../docs/RUNNER.md](../../docs/RUNNER.md): a CUDA toolchain that needs no system
installer, a cuBLAS provider behind the engine's `GemmProvider` interface, its tests against the reference
provider, and a benchmark. It is a CMake project of its own. It builds the engine in `runner/` as a subdirectory
and changes nothing outside `runner/cuda/`.

Everything measured below was measured on one machine on 2026-10-09: Windows 11, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB
(compute capability 8.6), driver 591.86, MSVC 19.44, CMake 3.31, Ninja.

## What is and is not on the GPU yet

| On the GPU | Not on the GPU |
|---|---|
| Every matrix multiply: `Y = beta * Y + X W^T`, fp16 or fp32 operands, fp32 output | The DeltaNet recurrence, the causal convolution, the gated norm |
| Weights: uploaded once, kept on the device | Attention: RoPE, the K/V cache, scores, softmax |
| Element-type conversion of operands (fp32, fp16, bf16), by four small kernels compiled with `nvcc` | RMSNorm, SiLU, the SwiGLU product, the residual additions |
| A device arena: one allocation at start, none afterwards | The embedding lookup and the readout |
| | Activations between two multiplies: today each call uploads X and downloads Y |

So the engine cannot run a model on the GPU yet. The benchmark measures the matrix multiplies alone, which the
design takes to be about 80% of a pass (docs/RUNNER.md section 12, a figure measured elsewhere on another model).

## The toolchain

The CUDA Toolkit is not installed on this machine. NVIDIA publishes its components as Python wheels, and on
Windows the CUDA 13 wheels contain the whole compiler. `setup_toolchain.ps1` installs the versions pinned in
`toolchain-requirements.txt` into `runner/cuda/.toolchain/` (git-ignored, about 0.8 GB) with `uv`. They unpack into
one toolkit tree, `.toolchain/Lib/site-packages/nvidia/cu13/`.

| Package | Version | What it holds on Windows (by inspection) |
|---|---|---|
| `nvidia-cuda-nvcc` | 13.1.115 | `bin/nvcc.exe`, `cudafe++.exe`, `ptxas.exe`, `nvlink.exe`, `fatbinary.exe`, `bin2c.exe` |
| `nvidia-nvvm` | 13.1.115 | `nvvm/bin/cicc.exe`, `nvvm64_40_0.dll`, `nvvm/libdevice` |
| `nvidia-cuda-crt` | 13.1.115 | `include/crt`: the device-side runtime headers |
| `nvidia-cuda-runtime` | 13.1.80 | `cuda_runtime.h` and the other runtime headers; `lib/x64/cudart.lib`, `cudart_static.lib`, `cudadevrt.lib`, `cuda.lib`; `cudart64_13.dll` |
| `nvidia-cuda-cccl` | 13.1.115 | `include/cccl`: Thrust, CUB, libcu++ (not used yet) |
| `nvidia-cuda-nvrtc` | 13.1.115 | `nvrtc.h`, `nvrtc64_130_0.dll` (not used yet; no import library) |
| `nvidia-cublas` | 13.2.1.1 | `cublas_v2.h`, `cublas64_13.dll`, `cublasLt64_13.dll`; **no import library** |

This is CUDA 13.1 Update 1, the release the installed driver reports as its newest supported version
(`cudaDriverGetVersion` returns 13010). Three things found by inspection, not assumed:

- **The CUDA 12 wheels cannot compile CUDA C++ on Windows.** `nvidia-cuda-nvcc-cu12` (12.1.105 and 12.9.86 were
  unpacked) holds `ptxas.exe`, `nvvm64_40_0.dll` and `libdevice` only: no `nvcc.exe`, `cudafe++.exe` or `cicc.exe`.
  The unsuffixed CUDA 13 packages hold all of them, so full compilation with `nvcc` works: outcome (a).
- **No wheel ships `cublas.lib`.** The provider's import library is built at build time from
  `cublas64_13.def`, which lists the nine cuBLAS functions it calls, with MSVC's `lib /def`. A new cuBLAS call
  needs a new line in that file.
- **The executables link the CUDA runtime statically** (`cudart_static.lib`, CMake's default), so at run time they
  need only `cublas64_13.dll` and `cublasLt64_13.dll`, found through the `PATH`.

Newer CUDA 13 wheels exist (13.4.92 at the time of writing). They were not tried: a newer runtime than the
driver's is outside what this machine was tested with.

## Set up, build, test, run

From PowerShell in the repository root. Requirements: `uv`, Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ workload (it brings
CMake and Ninja), an NVIDIA GPU of the RTX 30 series or newer with a driver that supports CUDA 13.1.

```powershell
# 1. The toolchain (once; -Force deletes and recreates it)
pwsh runner/cuda/setup_toolchain.ps1

# 2. Configure, build, test
cmd /c '"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" >nul 2>&1 && cd runner\cuda && cmake --preset release && cmake --build --preset release && ctest --preset release'

# 3. Run the tools directly: cuBLAS must be on the PATH (CTest sets this up by itself)
$env:PATH = "$PWD\runner\cuda\.toolchain\Lib\site-packages\nvidia\cu13\bin\x86_64;$env:PATH"
runner\cuda\build\release\sepal_cuda_tests.exe            # or one suite: contract, parity_small, parity_real, rows
runner\cuda\build\release\sepal-cuda-bench.exe
runner\cuda\build\release\sepal-cuda-bench.exe --presets 0.8b --tokens 1024 --precisions f16 --reps 9
```

CMake options: `-DSEPAL_CUDA_ROOT=<toolkit root>` uses another CUDA 13 toolkit tree;
`-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="75;86"` adds Turing (the default is 86, Ampere and newer). The build takes the engine
from `runner/` with `add_subdirectory(.. sepal_core_build)` and switches the engine's own tests off; those belong
to the parent project. Warnings are errors for the C++ (`/W4 /WX`) and for the CUDA source (`-Werror=all-warnings`
and `/W4 /WX` for the host pass).

The CMake file has a branch for Linux. It has never been run.

## The provider

`include/sepal/cuda/cuda_gemm.hpp`, `src/cuda_gemm.cpp`, `src/convert_kernels.cu`.

- **Interface.** `sepal::cuda::CudaGemm` implements `sepal::GemmProvider::gemm_f`, with the same argument checks
  and messages as the reference provider.
- **Arena.** One `cudaMalloc` when the provider is created. Weights, device matrices and the cuBLAS workspace are
  taken from its bottom and stay; what a call borrows is taken from the rest and returned when the call ends,
  including when it throws. A call that does not fit throws and names the need, the free space and the option to
  raise.
- **Weights.** `upload_weights` copies a matrix to the device once and returns an id; `register_weights` also
  makes `gemm_f(x, w, ...)` recognise that host matrix (by pointer, element type and shape) and use the device
  copy. An unregistered `w` is uploaded for that call only.
- **Precision.** One path per provider. `F32`: fp32 operands (fp16 and bf16 inputs widened exactly),
  `cublasSgemm`. `F16`: fp16 operands (fp32 and bf16 inputs rounded to nearest on the device), `cublasGemmEx` with
  fp32 accumulation and fp32 output. cuBLAS accepts fp16 operands with an fp32 result directly, so no fp16 result
  is ever rounded.
- **Stream.** Every device call runs on a non-blocking stream the provider owns.
- **Errors.** `sepal::cuda::CudaError` carries the name of the failing call, the code and the library's text,
  for example `cudaSetDevice failed: invalid device ordinal (code 101)`.
- **Device-resident calls.** `upload_matrix`, `alloc_output`, `gemm_device`, `synchronize`, `download`: multiplies
  whose operands are already on the device and that do not wait. The benchmark uses them; the executor will.

## Parity with the reference provider

`sepal_cuda_tests parity_real`: random matrices at the six projection shapes of the 0.8B preset (hidden 1,024,
MLP 3,584) and of the 4B preset (hidden 2,560, MLP 9,216), 8 rows each, against the reference provider, which
accumulates in float64. Outputs have rms 0.33 and largest magnitude 1.8. `max_rel` is the largest elementwise
relative difference over the elements at least as large as the rms. Worst case over the twelve shapes:

| Path | Operands given to both providers | max abs difference | max relative difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| fp32 | fp32 | 5.960e-07 | 1.155e-06 |
| fp16 | fp16 | 1.216e-05 | 1.921e-05 |
| fp16 | fp32, which the CUDA provider rounds to fp16 (the reference keeps fp32) | 5.339e-04 | 1.088e-03 |

The second row is the arithmetic of the fp16 path alone; the third adds the cost of storing the operands in fp16.

## Row independence: the finding the design needs

The interface asks that an output row depend on its input row and the weights and on nothing else, and that a
row have the same bits alone or in any batch. `sepal_cuda_tests rows` asks four questions at the twelve real
shapes, with batch sizes T = 1, 2, 3, 7, 16, 64, 256 and 1,024.

| Question | fp32 | fp16 |
|---|---|---|
| Does a row depend on the **values** of the other rows in the batch? | No: bit-identical, 12 of 12 shapes | No: bit-identical, 12 of 12 |
| Does a row depend on its **position** in a batch of a given size? | No: bit-identical, 12 of 12 | No: bit-identical, 12 of 12 |
| Is a row alone bit-identical to the same row in a batch? | **No**, 0 of 12 shapes; 92-97% of elements differ | **No**, 0 of 12; up to 99.6% of elements differ |
| Do all batch sizes give one bit pattern? | **No**, 0 of 12 | **No**, 0 of 12 |
| Largest difference between batch sizes | 4.530e-06 (1.4e-05 of the output rms) | 1.252e-05 (3.8e-05 of the output rms) |

cuBLAS picks its kernel from the shape of the call, so a row's bits are a function of the row, the weights and the
batch size T. The groups of batch sizes that agree differ from shape to shape and follow no simple rule: for the
4B MLP up-projection in fp32 they are {1} {2,3,7} {16} {64,1024} {256}; for the 0.8B DeltaNet in-projection in
fp16 they are {1,2,3,7,16,256,1024} {64}. cuBLAS's pedantic mode (`CudaGemmOptions::pedantic`) changes none of the
four answers.

What this means for docs/RUNNER.md: with cuBLAS, "a cache hit and a cache miss compute identical bits" (section 6,
idea 3) holds only if every multiply of a given layer is called with the same T whatever the batch contains. That
is true by construction if T is always padded to one fixed size, and false if T is bucketed to several sizes or
left as it comes. The alternatives are a kernel of our own with a fixed summation order, which `nvcc` now makes
possible, or relaxing that gate to a tolerance of about 1e-4 of the output rms per multiply. This slice does not
choose.

## Benchmark

`sepal-cuda-bench`, pasted from its output. **These are the matrix multiplies only, so they are an upper bound on
engine throughput, not the engine's throughput.** Random weights and activations; fp32 outputs; 2 warm-up passes,
then the median of 5 timed passes, each ending with a wait for the device. "all GEMMs" is every projection of every
layer of a preset (the concatenated mixer in-projection, the mixer out-projection, the MLP's gate and up as one
multiply, the MLP's down), each with its own weights: 96 multiplies for 0.8B and 2B, 128 for 4B.

- "MLP layer device": the two multiplies of one MLP with operands on the device. "MLP layer host": the same two
  through `gemm_f`, which uploads X and downloads Y on every call; in fp16 that path takes 2.6 to 5.6 times as
  long as the device path, which is why activations must stay on the device.
- **4B in fp32 was not measured**: its weights are 13.30 GiB and 10.98 GiB of the card was free. The tool said so
  and skipped it.
- **Peak device memory** (the arena is allocated once; "took" is the fall in the driver's free-memory figure from
  just before the arena to its lowest point, so it includes cuBLAS but not the CUDA context):

  | Case | Weights | Arena | Arena used at peak | Provider with cuBLAS took |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | 0.8B fp16 | 0.93 GiB | 1.342 GiB | 1.267 GiB | 1.355 GiB |
  | 2B fp16 | 2.56 GiB | 3.182 GiB | 3.073 GiB | 3.193 GiB |
  | 4B fp16 | 6.65 GiB | 7.590 GiB | 7.421 GiB | 7.602 GiB |
  | 0.8B fp32 | 1.85 GiB | 2.347 GiB | 2.237 GiB | 2.357 GiB |
  | 2B fp32 | 5.11 GiB | 5.849 GiB | 5.676 GiB | 5.859 GiB |

  The arenas are sized for the largest case measured, 4,096 tokens, and hold the benchmark's activation buffers.
- The fp16 path runs at 23 to 25 TFLOP/s from 1,024 tokens up, and the fp32 path at about 7.2: fp16 is 3.3 times
  faster on this card. At 64 tokens both paths lose a third to a half of that.
- What the tool does not measure: the fp32-to-fp16 conversion of activations between multiplies that an fp16
  engine needs, and everything in the right-hand column of the first table.

### Against the design's derived figures

docs/RUNNER.md section 12 derives its GPU figures from other people's measurements. Its "8 GB GPU" row is the one
anchored on a llama.cpp report for an RTX 3060; it gives alerts per second without a cache for a 1,000-token
alert, which is the same number in thousands of tokens per second. The measured column is "all GEMMs" in fp16 at 1,024 tokens. The
last column multiplies it by 0.8, the design's own assumed GEMM share of a pass; that factor is the design's
assumption, not a measurement of ours.

| Model | Design, derived (tokens/s) | Measured, GEMM only | Measured x 0.8 | Reading |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.8B | 10,000 to 20,000 | 23,201 | 18,561 | Consistent: inside the range, near its top |
| 2B | 4,000 to 8,000 | 8,642 | 6,914 | Consistent: inside the range |
| 4B | 3,200 to 4,300 | 3,458 | 2,766 | Optimistic: the upper bound alone is 20% under the top of the range, and with the 0.8 factor it is 14% under the bottom |

Against the stage exit criteria (section 16), which are full-engine targets, so the GEMM-only figure can only
show whether they are reachable:

- R2, "at least 10,000 tokens/s on 0.8B": the multiplies alone run at 23,201, 2.3 times the target. Reachable.
- R2, "at least 3,500 tokens/s on 4B": the multiplies alone run at 3,458 (1,024 tokens) and 3,368 (4,096 tokens),
  1% and 4% **under** the target before anything else in the pass is counted. A pass that runs every multiply
  through fp16 cuBLAS on this card cannot meet it; with the 0.8 factor the expectation is about 2,770 tokens/s,
  21% under.
- R3, "at least 4 alerts/s on 4B without a cache": one 1,024-token pass of multiplies takes 296 ms, so about 3.4
  alerts per second is the ceiling for such a pass.

The 4B targets need either a faster multiply than cuBLAS fp16 gives here (the int8 paths of R4 are the design's
candidate, unmeasured) or less work per alert (last-layer pruning, the prefix cache).

## What should move to the GPU next

1. Keep activations on the device between multiplies: an executor that owns device buffers and calls
   `gemm_device`, with the residual stream in fp32 and an fp16 copy made by the conversion kernel.
2. The elementwise and per-row operations, as `nvcc`-compiled kernels: RMSNorm, SiLU and the SwiGLU product,
   residual additions. They are small but sit between every pair of multiplies.
3. The DeltaNet scan: convolution, the delta-rule recurrence and the gated norm. It is the only sequential part
   and the one the design adapts from Strata.
4. Attention: per-head norm, RoPE, the K/V cache and the tiled causal kernel.
5. Decide the row-independence question above before the executor fixes how T is chosen.
